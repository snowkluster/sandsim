# SandSim

## Options
The program accepts two command line arguments: `-tps` and `-size`. The -tps argument modifies the update speed of the game cells, measured in Ticks Per Second (TPS). Its usage is as follows: `-tps=50`. The `-size` argument is intended to adjust the size of the game, but is currently experiencing functionality issues. Its usage is exemplified as follows: `-size=500`
